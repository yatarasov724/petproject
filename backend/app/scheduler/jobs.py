Scheduler job definitions.

poll_job    — runs every 60 s, drives the full pipeline
cleanup_job — runs every 24 h, purges stale DB rows

Each job:
  - opens its own DB connection (one per job run, not per article)
  - delegates all article-level logic to orchestrator.process()
  - emits metrics via app.core.metrics
  - closes the connection in finally
